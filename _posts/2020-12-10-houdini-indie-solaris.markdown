# Houdini Indie

As an independent filmmaker or indie game developer, your goal is to
create professional-quality work with a small team and tight
budget. [Houdini Indie][indie] helps you accomplish this by making all the
features of Houdini FX affordable for indies.

For me the important bit is that Houdini Indie allows you to work with
**3rd party renderers** and that SideFX, the company behind Houdini is
leading the way (in cooperation with [Pixar][pixar]) towards a better
renderer integration via [Hydra][hydra] Render Delegates and
[USD][usd].

Solaris" width="740" class="img-thumbnail"/>

I prepared a simple [YouTube][youtube] video about the **Cornell Box**
visible above. I will provide a Houdini Indie scene at some point but
here are two video sessions which should help you to get started with
Solaris, Karma, 3rd party renderers etc.:

1. Jeff Wagner's [tutorial][shipshape] about this year's [RenderMan Art
   Challenge][art-challenge].
2. Varomix Wey's [3rd party rendering in Solaris][3rd-party] series of
   videos. With its USD support, **Solaris** has access to any
   renderer designed to work as a Hydra delegate - renderers such as
   Pixar's [RenderMan][prman], Autodesk's [Arnold][arnold], and
   Maxon's [Redshift][redshift].

## More to come ...
