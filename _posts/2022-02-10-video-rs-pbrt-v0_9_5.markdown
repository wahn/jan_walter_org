So, I started working on a **library** (called
[blend_info][blend_info]) to deal with reading data from Blenderâ€˜s
binary `.blend` files. In the past I was able to render some **Blender
v2.79** files, now I abstracted the library to deal (in theory) with
all Blender versions (using the **DNA** information). I tested with
two scenes for Blender 2.79 and **Blender 3.0** (which should be quiet
different from the GUI perspective). With v2.79 I got away with a
**naming convention** and mis-using the **old material settings** (pre
[Cycles][cycles] renderer). Blender 3.0 forced me to get some material
settings from **shader nodes** and the library allows to **follow
pointers** from one data structure to the next. Prove of concept:
Both, the **Cornell Box**, as well as the **Radiance Conference
Room**, render with both Blender scene versions. Get the latest
Blender scenes [here][gitlab].
