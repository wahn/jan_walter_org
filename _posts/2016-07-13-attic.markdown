## Blender Cloud

I started using [Blender][blender] scenes from the [Blender
Cloud][cloud]. The intention behind that is

1. to remind people to support the [Blender Institute][about]
2. to use more and more realistic scenes for my render tests
3. to make my [multi exporter][exporter] more stable and production ready
4. because the scenes and textures being used are getting too big to be stored via [git][git]
5. I'm probably going to retire the [repository][repository] for my test scenes
6. that I will provide [download][download] links instead 

## Cycles

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/attic_cycles_cloud.png"
alt="Attic scene from Blender Cloud." width="740"
class="img-thumbnail"/></p>

[Cycles][cycles] was used to render the original scene from the
[Blender Cloud][cloud] and uses volumetric effects like scatter and
absorption. If you click on the [Attic][attic] link in the
[download][download] section you will be able to get two Blender files
from the cloud. One with, one without the fog. I modified the scene
slightly to work with my [multi exporter][exporter] and if you click
on the [Cycles][attic_cycles] link (in the [download][download]
section) you will be able to download the __modified scene__. The main
difference is to simplify the material node network to use simple
materials, like pure diffuse, a mix of diffuse and glossy, or a mix of
diffuse and transparent. In the future I might add other combinations,
but texturing (as required by the scene) is supported.

## Radiance

alt="Radiance helps with tweaking settings for other renderers."
width="740" class="img-thumbnail"/></p>

The current state of the [Radiance][radiance] exporter doesn't support
textures (yet), but I still like to use the renderer to see the light
distribution within the un-textured scene and to analyze it, e.g. by
using __falsecolor__ [option][option]:

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/attic_radiance_lux.png"
alt="Radiance can be used to visualize the distribution of light."
width="740" class="img-thumbnail"/></p>

Here are the commands I used to render two images with Radiance and
mix them to visualize the amount of Lux arriving at different parts of
the scene via __falsecolor contours__:

{% highlight tcsh %}
rad -n attic.rif > attic.sh
sh attic.sh
rpict -vp 3.4038350582122803 1.1545137166976929 -0.8958941102027893 -vd -0.9505669474601746 -0.28570425510406494 0.1216370165348053 -vu 0.14788036048412323 -0.07206873595714569 0.9863760471343994 -vh 59.48976259388444 -vv 35.63777782904556 -x 2880 -y 1620 -dp 2048 -ar 39 -ms 0.13 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -ss 16 -st .01 -ab 2 -af attic.amb -aa .1 -ad 1536 -as 768 -av 0.01 0.01 0.01 -lr 12 -lw 1e-5 -ps 5 -pt .04 -i attic.oct > attic_1_irr.unf

ra_tiff attic_lux.hdr attic_lux.tiff
imf_copy attic_lux.tiff attic_lux.png
{% endhighlight %}

The details about this procedure are explained in a previous blog
[post][post].

## Luxrender

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/attic_luxrender.png"
alt="Luxrender rendering with textures but without fog."  width="740"
class="img-thumbnail"/></p>

As you might have noticed the [Radiance][radiance] rendering doesn't
show the __holes in the roof__ as in the original scene. The reason
for that is the missing support for textures, because the holes are
basically created by a mix of a diffuse with a transparent material,
__controlled__ by a texture to indicate the __transparency__. The
[Luxrender][luxrender] rendering shows those holes, but I used a
slighly different texture (and uv-coordinates) in comparison to the
original scene. In the future I might add __fog__ for those renderers
which support __volumes__. See [Haunted Hallway - Luxrender and
PRMan][volumes] scene.

## Arnold

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/attic_arnold.png"
alt="Arnold rendering with textures but without fog."  width="740"
class="img-thumbnail"/></p>

With some manual tweaking of [Arnold][arnold]'s render options you can
achieve rendering times around 2 hours. The already tweaked
[Arnold][arnold] scene description can be found
[here][attic_arnold]. There is also one single shader (__alLayer__
from [alShaders][alshaders]) included (compiled for Arnold version
4.2.14.1 on Linux) which is used to mix two standard shaders.
