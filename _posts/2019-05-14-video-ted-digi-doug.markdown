In an astonishing talk and tech demo, software researcher __Doug
Roble__ debuts "DigiDoug": a real-time, 3-D, digital rendering of his
likeness that's accurate down to the scale of pores and
wrinkles. Powered by an inertial motion capture suit, deep neural
networks and enormous amounts of data, DigiDoug renders the real
Doug's emotions (and even how his blood flows and eyelashes move) in
striking detail. Learn more about how this exciting tech was built -
and its applications in movies, virtual assistants and beyond.
