There is a new scene called __Bedroom__ in the [repository][repo]. The
__.obj__ file was downloaded from the [3drender.com][3drender_com] web
site and cleaned up a bit (e.g. making sure all normals point
outwards). Here an image rendered by [Lagoa][lagoa]:

<img src="/assets/bedroom_lagoa01.png" alt="Bedroom rendered by
Lagoa." width="600" class="img-thumbnail"/>

Some textures were taken from [cgtextures.com][cgtextures_com]:

1. __CardboardPlain0016_2_M.jpg__ for the box below the bed.
2. __FabricPatterns0007_M.jpg__ for the sheet.
3. __FabricPatterns0013_M.jpg__ for the blanket.
4. __WoodPlanksClean0049_3_M.jpg__ for the floor.
5. __WoodFine0001_2_S.jpg__ for the furniture.

The textures for the posters on the wall were found via __Google__ image search.
