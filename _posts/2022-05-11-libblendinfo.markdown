# libblendinfo

Can the **Rust** crate [blend_info][blend_info] be wrapped in a way
that it can be used from within **C**?

This question I asked to myself (see [ticket][ticket] on
sourcehut). There you can find links to another Rust crate and a blog
post describing the experience of [Exposing a Rust library to
C][greyblake].

## Keep FFI separate from Rust crate

One decision I made after reading the blog post, was that I wanted to
keep the Rust crate separate from it's (example) usage from within
C/C++. And sourcehut supports the work on a common [project][project],
which keeps certain aspects separate in it's own git [repositories][repositories]:

1. Rust crate: [https://git.sr.ht/~wahn/blend_info][git_blend_info]
2. C bindings: [https://git.sr.ht/~wahn/libblendinfo][libblendinfo]

## A Start

As a start I created a simple C example file (called **camera.c**):

```C
#include "blendinfo.h"

int main(void) {
  char* filename = "blend/factory_v279.blend";
  char* camera = "Camera";
  extract_struct(filename, camera);
}
```

So, you provide two strings, the name of the Blender file to read, and
the kind of information you are interested in (in this case cameras).

The header file (**blendinfo.h**) contains a single function prototype (in C):

```C
void extract_struct(char* filename, char* structname);
```

That same C function looks like this on the **Rust** side:

```Rust
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn extract_struct(fn_ptr: *const c_char,
                                        sn_ptr: *const c_char) {
...
    let read_dna_result = read_dna(...)
...
    let use_dna_result = use_dna(...)
...
}
```

## What's missing?

One thing which is obviously missing is the return of those bytes
being relevant to cameras to the caller (in C). Once that's solved the
C/C++ caller could simply create a struct like the one returned from
the standalone `blend_info` executable (written in Rust and using the
`blend_info` crate). See [official documentation][blend_info_docs]:

```
$ ./target/release/blend_info -n Camera blend/factory_v279.blend
Camera 248
struct Camera { // SDNAnr = 25
    ID id; // 120
    AnimData *adt; // 8
    char type; // 1
    char dtx; // 1
    short flag; // 2
    float passepartalpha; // 4
    float clipsta; // 4
    float clipend; // 4
    float lens; // 4
    float ortho_scale; // 4
    float drawsize; // 4
    float sensor_x; // 4
    float sensor_y; // 4
    float shiftx; // 4
    float shifty; // 4
    float YF_dofdist; // 4
    Ipo *ipo; // 8
    Object *dof_ob; // 8
    GPUDOFSettings gpu_dof; // 24
    char sensor_fit; // 1
    char pad[7]; // 7
    CameraStereoSettings stereo; // 24
}; // 248
```

If that return value is a memory block with exactly the same order of
bytes as needed (with proper [endianness][endianness]) the number of
bytes being returned should be a multiple of 248 bytes (but only for
this particular Blender version) and in C you should be able to just
use a pointer to step through those bytes and interpret them e.g. to
read the clipping start float value (`clipsta`) and do whatever you
need to do on the C/C++ side.

## Help

Why do I publish the current state, instead of waiting until the C/C++
library can be used or coming up with a more complicated example?

In my opinion the Rust crate already allows you to extract any
information you need from a Blender file (using the DNA
information). But one can not ignore the developers using C/C++ and
centuries of library development in those languages. This is your
chance to have a say, how the wrapper of the Rust code will look like
and how you wish to use it. The [rs-pbrt][rs-pbrt] crate/excutable is
a full renderer written in Rust, with **Ambient Occlusion** (AO),
**Direct Lighting** (no Global Illumination), **Whittedâ€™s
ray-tracing** algorithm, (Uni-directional) **Path Tracing** (Global
Illumination), **Bidirectional Path Tracing**, **Metropolis Light
Transport** (MLT), and **Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping**
(SPPM),) which also accounts for attenuation from participating media
as well as scattering from surfaces. All of this is based on the
**third edition** of the [PBRT book][pbrt_book]. The C++ code for the
forth edition is alreay out there on GitHub, the book is not available
(yet). Anyway, the Rust code comes with an example file
`parse_blend_file`, which can render Blender files directly (instead
of using `.pbrt` files for version 3 of the file format described in
the book). This is using already the [blend_info][blend_info] Rust
crate to extract information directly from `.blend` files and is an
example usage for such a Rust integration. Once the C library is
finished there is no reason you could not use the extracted bytes for
other things, like an **OpenGL** or **Vulkan** based scene viewer
etc. ...

[mailing-lists][mailing-lists]. You might have to learn how to use
[plaintext][plaintext] email to participate, but that's a small thing
to ask.
