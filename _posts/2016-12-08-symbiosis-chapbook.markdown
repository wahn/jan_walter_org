It's a world-building, world-exploring book __made to be shared__ and
built upon. The book is [Creative Commons][creative_commons] licensed,
which means that you can take anything from [Symbiosis][symbiosis] and
use it in any way you want. Change it, use it in gaming, cosplay,
novels, comics, and anything else you can come up with.

The art book will be published by __Steven Sanders__ and you can click
this [link][symbiosis] to get a __beta version__ (shortened version)
at a __Pay-What-You-Want__ price. The book was financed by backers of
his [kickstarter][kickstarter] campain and isn't released yet. But the
shortened version already contains 80 pages with a lot of __Steven
Sanders__ artwork.
