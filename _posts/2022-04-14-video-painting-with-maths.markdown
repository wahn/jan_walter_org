# Video

[Inigo Quilez][iquilezles] released a new [video][youtube] about
creating a landscape:

{% highlight text %}
It explains how to use maths to art direct the painting of a landscape.
I describe the formulas needed to do sculpting, surfacing and illumination.
It's long and dense, so watching it a few times to get everything to sink over
time is a good idea.
{% endhighlight %}

class="img-thumbnail"/></a></div>

I really like his videos and see the effect of each formula being
visualized and animated.
