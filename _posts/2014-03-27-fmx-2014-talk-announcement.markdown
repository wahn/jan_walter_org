Two years ago I did a more general overview about different GI
renderers and algorithms being used, by showing them in action with
very simple example scenes. In the meantime I replaced some of the
exporters I was using in my demo with a __multi-exporter__, which
simultaneously outputs to several renderers in one go. This talk will
open the __source code__ to you to learn from, provide a
[forum][forum] to share experience, will give you information about
the __current state__ of several __repositories__ being used for
render comparisons, provide access to those, and will give you hints
about __future development__ and how you can contribute to
it. Basically the talk will try to motivate you to get your own hands
dirty, get you started with comparing renderers, and will show you a
place to share and discuss your findings with others.
