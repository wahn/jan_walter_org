We have seen the [Conference Room][conf-room] scene before (in other
posts). It was originally created for [Radiance][radiance]. The room
does (or at least did) exist in reality and was painstakingly measured
and re-created in a text editor ([vi][vi]). See __README__ file and
credits in the [repository][repo], where I keep my test scenes in
various formats.

Here are the first results for [Pixar's][Pixar] renderer
[RenderMan][renderman]:
