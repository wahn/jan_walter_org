Last week I got my copy of the latest edition of
the [Physically Based Rendering Book][pbrt_book]. It comes with the
full source code of a renderer (called __pbrt__) and the sources will
be kept up to date in a __GitHub__ [repository][repository]. There you
will find also information on how to clone a git repository with over
6GB of __example scenes__. As a start I compiled the sources on OS X
and Linux and rendered a day and night scene:
