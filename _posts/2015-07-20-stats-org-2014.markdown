The [web site][org] went online on __March 13th__ of __2014__, as you
can see here:

13th janwalter.org was born." width="650" class="img-thumbnail"/>

In __July 2015__ we moved to another web cluster and this means the
end of the current statistics software. So let's publish the latest
results before deciding where to go from here:

13th janwalter.org was born." width="650" class="img-thumbnail"/>

I guess the first and last month do not tell you a lot, so let's
compare last year (__2014__) to this year (__2015__) by looking at the
monthly traffic:

some statistics failures." width="650" class="img-thumbnail"/>

<img src="/assets/janwalter_org_2015.png" alt="The statistics for 2015
will end in July." width="650" class="img-thumbnail"/>

The traffic went up, but probably hit a peak in March 2015.

for July of 2015." width="740" class="img-thumbnail"/>
