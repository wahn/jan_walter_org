One of the most basic scenes for Global Illumination (GI) is the
[Cornell Box][cornell_box]. In the [download][download] section I
provide the scene for several renderers:

+ Arnold
+ Cycles
+ Indigo
+ Luxrender
+ Maxwell
+ mental ray
+ PRMan
+ Radiance

But here I want to focus on [Pixar's][Pixar] last release of
[RenderMan][renderman] (__PRMan__). You can download a free version of
the renderer for [non-commercial][nc-prman] usage. Pixar's scene
description is called [RIB][RIB] (__R__enderMan __I__nterface
__B__ytestream Protocol). If you download the Cornell Box RIB file and
render it with PRMan your resulting image should look like this:

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/cornell_box_prman.png"
alt="Cornell Box rendered by RenderMan."  width="500"
class="img-thumbnail"/></p>

For convenience the file is also available from Pixar's [Community
Resources][resources]. I will only point out the details about RIB
lines which are new or specific to the latest PRMan release:

{% endhighlight %}

For [RIS][RIS] we need to use the [Raytrace Hider][hider] with
path-tracing. In theory we have the choice between __unidirectional__
and __bidirectional path tracing__, but in this case we have chosen
the bidirectional version by specifiying [PxrVCM][PxrVCM] as our
integrator. The remaining RIB file lines are pretty much standard,
except the __Surface__ shader lines got replaced by __Bxdf__ material
lines. For the Cornell Box we only need diffuse materials which are
explained in the [LMDiffuse][LMDiffuse] RenderMan 19
Documentation. The one and only light source in the scene is an area
light using the [PxrAreaLight][PxrAreaLight] shader.

Before you start to render your own version of the image above you
should set an environment variable called __$RMANTREE__:

{% highlight tcsh %}
setenv RMANTREE /Applications/Pixar/RenderManProServer-19.0
{% endhighlight %}

The syntax above is for [tcsh][tcsh], for [bash][bash] use the
following:

{% highlight bash %}
export RMANTREE=/Applications/Pixar/RenderManProServer-19.0
{% endhighlight %}

To render use the following command line:

{% highlight tcsh %}
$RMANTREE/bin/prman -progress cornell_box.rib
{% endhighlight %}

We will see other scenes later using __unidirectional path
tracing__. I modified the [multi_exporter][multi_exporter] Python
script for [Blender][blender] to use the new PRMan shaders and materials.
