The [web site][org] went online on __March 13th__ of __2014__, as you
can see here:

13th janwalter.org was born." width="650" class="img-thumbnail"/>

In __June__ we switched from http to __https__, which confused the
statistics software, until my provider, [JPBerlin][jpberlin] fixed the
problem:

some statistics failures." width="650" class="img-thumbnail"/>

The [renderforum][renderforum] was started in the __US__, hosted by
[GoDaddy][godaddy], and moved from [.com][com] to [.org][org], hosted
in __Berlin, Germany__, by [JPBerlin][jpberlin]. On __June 16th__ I
announnced that the main developer of [Cycles][cycles], __Brecht van
Lommel__, now works for [Solid Angle][solid-angle], the company behind
the __Arnold__ renderer. This caused a temporary peak in the
[renderforum][renderforum] statistics:

works for Solid Angle." width="650" class="img-thumbnail"/>

The [renderforum][renderforum] has currently __49 members__, but the
statistics show that we have visitors from all over the world:

of the renderforum for 2014." width="650" class="img-thumbnail"/>

I wouldn't mind if more people would __register__ and
__participate__. So far it feels like a broadcast (with some
listeners), so no real two way communication, but that hopefully
changes at some point. During registration you have to answer a
question:

__Who is the owner of this web page?__

Shouldn't be too hard to guess ...

I also wouldn't mind if people would start using __encryption__
wherever they can. [keybase.io][keybase_io] is a good starting point
to find people's __public keys__ (for [PGP][pgp] or [GPG][gpg]) and
make sure the provided identities are confirmed.

__Happy New Year !!!__

Cheers,

Jan
