Jan Walter's Blog
=================

This is the **Jekyll** source for https://www.janwalter.org.

I first looked into [Scott Chacons
Blog](https://github.com/schacon/schacon.github.com) as an example,
but soon realized that I could start from running:

    jekyll new jan_walter_org

Based on [a
tutorial](https://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example/tutorial)
I decided to use some of [Bootstrap's many
components](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples).
