Jan Walter's Blog
=================

This is the Jekyll source for www.janwalter.org.

I first looked into [Scott Chacons
Blog](https://github.com/schacon/schacon.github.com) as an example,
but soon realized that I could start from running:

{% highlight shell %}
jekyll new jan_walter_org
{% endhighlight %}
